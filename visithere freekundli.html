        <h2>Kundli Reading</h2>
        <p>Kundli making and Kundli reading in India is one of the ancient practices used for predicting one's future and discovery of life events. Also called a birth chart or horoscope, a Kundli entails the karmic map of the person’s past, present and future events, pictured after learning the movement of planets, constellations and much more.</p>

        <p>It is a belief that once a person has the chart of his life prepared, it can help him in making better choices in life. Apart from this, your Kundli can also give you a picture of your mental, emotional, physical and spiritual state of mind and how it would pan out as you grow.</p>

        <h2>Significance and Importance of Kundli Reading</h2>
        <p>The significance of Kundli can be asserted from the fact that it is one of the first things that most Indian parents consider preparing for their child soon after his/her birth. A person’s birth chart is prepared after taking into account their date of birth, place of birth, and time of birth.</p>

        <p>Based on this information, an astrologer can find the astrological position of different planets in the different houses of the Kundli at the time of the child's birth. These positions not only define the person's character but also help in understanding the effect of various planets on different aspects of life, such as love, marriage, education, and career.</p>

        <h2>What Can Kundli and Kundli Reading Help You With?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Finding doshas and yogas in your chart, such as Manglik dosha or Gajakesari yoga.</li>
            <li>Matching the Kundli of a girl and boy before fixing their marriage.</li>
            <li>Predicting the challenges and opportunities in your future.</li>
            <li>Helping in better decision-making for yourself and loved ones.</li>
            <li>Determining the best career path based on your efforts and intellect.</li>
            <li>Finding solutions for problems like job delays or marriage delays.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting to Know Planets, Signs, and Houses in Astrology</h2>

        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 1 - Planets in Astrology Meaning</h3>
            <p>Planets in astrology meaning
                Step 1 is the introductory step. So in step 1 of learning how to read your kundli, we will learn about planets and houses in astrology as they are the soul and heart of any kundli along with signs in kundli. Each planet and house in astrology denotes a thing or two. They carry specific traits, which could either bear positive or negative results on the native. In astrology, planets, signs and houses don't work in stagnation and all of them are dependent on each other and contribute in bringing a change in the life of a person.
                
                Entire astrology is based primarily on nine planets, twelve signs, twenty-seven Nakshatras and twelve houses (Bhava). Any astrology prediction by the best astrologers in India is based on permutations and combinations of these elements. In a nutshell, an astrologer, when reading your Kundli, would look at the positions of different planets, signs in different houses at the time of your birth and compare them with their current positions to allow you life predictions.
                
                The nine planets in astrology are:
                Planet	Sanskrit Name
                Sun	सूर्य (Surya)
                Moon	चंद्र, सोम (Chandra, Som)
                Mars	मंगल, कुज (Mangal, Kuja)
                Mercury	बुध (Budha)
                Jupiter	गुरू, बृहस्पति (Guru, Brihaspati)
                Venus	शुक्र (Shukra)
                Saturn	शनि (Shani)
                North Node	राहु (Rahu)
                South Node	केतु (Ketu)
                Each of these planets in astrology has certain traits that they infuse into the person. The intensity of giving out these traits change with respect to their placement in the kundli or their conjunction with other planets. This is something that you will understand going forward. For now, you just need to be aware of what each of the planets in astrology means or denote.
                
                Sun - Self, confidence, father, vitality, creativity and power. Moon - Emotions, mind, mother, nourishment, creativity, response, sensitivity. Mars - Bravery, aggression, courage. Venus - Harmony, love and affection, companionship, luxury, creativity. Jupiter - Expansion, optimism, maturity, knowledge, luck. Saturn - Responsibility, limitation, stability, commitment, hard work. Mercury - Intelligence to interpret, analytical skills, communication, perception, expression. Rahu - Explosiveness, obsession, freedom, illusion, Materialistic gains. Ketu - Intuition, imagination, transformation, intensity, elimination.
                
                Signs in astrology and their meaning
                Now that we have understood about the 9 planets in astrology and their meaning, going forward we need to look at 12 signs in astrology. Interestingly, signs and planets in astrology share a close relationship. Each zodiac sign is governed by a planet and in this way, the planet brings its characteristics to the sign.
                
                For example, the zodiac sign Taurus is governed by Venus. Venus traits (as mentioned above), being that of love and relationship, thus makes the Taurus natives romantic and very sensual (Taurus, relatable isn't it?). Signs in astrology have much more to contribute when it comes to learning how to read a kundli. However, we will learn that in another lesson.
                
                Here are 12 zodiac signs and the planets governing them.
                Zodiac Signs	Their governing planets
                Aries	Mars
                Taurus	Venus
                Gemini	Mercury
                Cancer	Moon
                Leo	Sun
                Virgo	Mercury
                Libra	Venus
                Scorpio	Mars
                Sagittarius	Jupiter
                Capricorn	Saturn
                Aquarius	Saturn
                Pisces	Jupiter
                Houses in astrology and their meaning
                Have you seen those kundli diagrams or charts, which actually seem like some kind of rocket science to decipher? The diagram, also called the birth chart, is an amalgamation of 12 houses. Each of these 12 houses in astrology means or represent a thing or two. For example, the second house represents wealth, the fifth house represents children and so on.
                
                Each of these houses is ruled by a zodiac sign. Also, planets in astrology (mentioned above) move from one house to another throughout a person's life thus altering the aspect (education, love, career, etc.) of that house from time to time. Again you will understand all of this in the upcoming chapters. For now, all you need to understand is the 12 houses in astrology and what they represent.
                
                Houses in kundli and what they mean:
                First House: It is the house of Self.
                Second House: It is the house of Wealth and Family.
                Third house: It is the house of Siblings, Courage and Valour.
                Fourth House: It is a house of Mother and Happiness.
                Fifth House: It is the house of Children and Knowledge.
                Sixth House: It is the house of Enemies, Debts and Diseases.
                Seventh House: It is the house of Marriage and Partnership.
                Eighth House: It is the house of Longevity or Ayu Bhava.
                Ninth House: It is the house of Luck, Father and Religion.
                Tenth House: It is the house of Career or Profession.
                Eleventh House: It is the house of Income & Gains.
                Twelfth House: It is the house of Expenditure & Losses.
